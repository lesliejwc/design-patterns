# Design Patterns

This repository is a showcase of design pattern implementations, illustrating
the use cases for these patterns and serves as reference material.


### Introduction

A design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem 
in software design. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem 
that can be used in many different situations.


### Patterns

#### Creational

Creational design patterns are about class instantiation. They solve issues 
related to object creation and prevent unnecessary complexity to the design.

#### Structural

Structural design patterns are about composition, it helps the realization of 
relationships between the entities, what are the neccessary and what are the 
unecessary relationships within your design.

#### Behavioural

Behavioural design patterns are those that are concerned with communication 
between objects. They can make these communications more flexible and be more 
adaptable to change.
